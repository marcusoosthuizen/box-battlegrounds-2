# box-battlegrounds-2

Box Battlegrounds 2 is a remake / sequal to a game I made roughly 3 years ago for a school competition. It started off as a small test to better learn the Love2D framework but ended up becoming its own thing. 

In the game, 2 players will face off against each other on one computer, one controlling with w a s d and the other with the arrow keys. The aim is to knockout your opponent by hitting and shrinking them while taking the size restoring pickups to increase your lead. It is a first to 3 wins format and every round will be shaken up in some unique ways. From gravity, darkness and earthquakes to black holes, flashbangs and owo?!?! There is much fun to be had!

You can find downloads for windows, mac and linux <a href="">here</a>. Or you could clone the repo and run the game from the source code.  
Also feel free to modify the game as you wish, I don't really care (that much)

Might add local multiplayer and more modes one day. Who knows :)
